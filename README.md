A ü§ñ &nbsp;for drafting and publishing new GitHub discussions using pull requests.

Do you use GitHub discussions? Do you create announcements for your open-source projects or team posts? How do you get feedback or peer reviews on your post before creating it?

Now you can:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp;Create a pull request to get feedback from your teammates on your announcement\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp;Merge the pull request to have your announcement posted!

You can even use private repos to draft announcements and get feedback privately, and on merge have the announcement created in your public repo.

No more copy/pasting your post content into Google Docs. No more rewriting the markdown. Write the markdown once, get feedback and merge üöÄ This works on repository discussions, organization discussions, and legacy team posts.

## Getting Started

1. Install the [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/announcement-drafter) and authorize it for any repositories or orgs you would like it to watch or post to.
2. Add a `.github/announcement-drafter.yml` (not `.yaml`) configuration file to any repositories you want the bot to watch.

   1. Provide what folders you want the `announcement-drafter` bot to watch and (optionally) what folders you would like it to ignore when new pull requests are open.

   ```yml
   watch_folders:
     - docs/discussions/
   ```

3. Create a markdown (`*.md`) file with some metadata at the top - see [Draft an Org or Repository Discussion](#draft-an-org-or-repository-discussion) or [Draft a team post](#draft-a-team-post)
4. Write your discussion in the body of the markdown file
5. Create a pull request
6. `announcement-drafter` will pick it up
7. When the pull request is merged, it will create the discussion for you

### Draft an Org or Repository Discussion

A note on org discussions: Org discussions are backed by repository discussions, so just point to the repository used by your org discussions and ü™Ñ it will work!

```markdown
<!--
repo: https://github.com/philip-gai/announcement-drafter-demo
category: announcements
-->

<!-- This is the discussion title -->
# Hello World! üëã

<!-- This is the discussion body -->
Hello beautiful world! üåé

```

### Draft a Team Post

```markdown
<!--
team: https://github.com/orgs/elastico-group/teams/everyone
-->

<!-- This is the post title -->
# Hello World! üëã

<!-- This is the post body -->
Hello beautiful world! üåé

```

## FAQ

### I opened a pull request, but I never received a comment on the pull request from Announcement Drafter. What did I do wrong?

Make sure that you:

1. Installed the app on the repository you created the pull request from
2. Added a `.github/announcement-drafter.yml` file to the repository with `watch_folders`
3. Created a new `*.md` file inside one of the `watch_folders` from a branch
   1. Announcement Drafter will *only* process files that were added. It will not process files that were removed, modified, renamed, copied, changed or unchanged.
4. Opened a pull request targeting the repository's default branch (i.e. `main`)
   1. Announcement Drafter will ignore draft pull requests

Also, try closing and re-opening your PR after making any changes to the announcement drafter configuration to trigger the flow again.
